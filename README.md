# studio-improvisations-2015-16
Music studio in Laos  focused on group improvisation. I am interested in testing out any experimental codecs/filters ect...that can graphically display changes in sound, movement and/or light (i.e the arrow-based motion filters in directshow which look amazing and have a great deal of potential as an educational tool for muscians assessing ergonomics in their playing or just "stage presense"tAll of the improvised recordings here are shot in the same room using only a Sony HDR MV camera (  AAC / H.264 1810p). Feel free to use the recordings and contact me if you have any suggestions, requests or would like to collaborate on a project.
